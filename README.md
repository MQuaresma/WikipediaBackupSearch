# WikipediaBackupSearch
Project developed in the Computer Labs 3 subject at **Universidade do Minho** which parses XML (backup) files, AKA snapshots, from articles in **Wikipedia**. The utility answers to a number of predefined queries related to the articles such as the number of revisions or the number of new articles between snapshots. The same utility has been implemented in both Java and C.
